## 1. What is Ionic?

Ionic is a popular open-source framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. How do you create a new Ionic project?

To create a new Ionic project, you can use the Ionic CLI command ionic start. Here's an example:

```bash
ionic start myApp blank
```

## 3. How do you run an Ionic app on a specific platform?

You can use the ionic cordova run command followed by the platform name. For example, to run an Ionic app on Android:

```bash
ionic cordova run android
```

## 4. How do you navigate between pages in Ionic?

Ionic provides the NavController to handle navigation. Here's an example of navigating to a new page:

```typescript
import { NavController } from '@ionic/angular';

constructor(private navCtrl: NavController) {}

goToPage() {
  this.navCtrl.navigateForward('/new-page');
}
```

## 5. How do you display a modal in Ionic?

You can use the ModalController to create and display a modal. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { ModalController } from '@ionic/angular';

constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) {}

async presentModal() {
  const modal = await this.modalCtrl.create({
    component: MyModalComponent,
    componentProps: { value: 123 }
  });
  return await modal.present();
}
```

## 6. How do you make HTTP requests in Ionic?

Ionic provides the HttpClient module to make HTTP requests. Here's an example of making a GET request:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

getData() {
  return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
}
```

## 7. How do you handle device features like camera and geolocation in Ionic?

Ionic uses plugins to interact with device features. For example, to access the device's camera:

```typescript
import { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera/ngx';

constructor(private camera: Camera) {}

takePicture() {
  this.camera.getPicture().then((imageData) => {
    // Handle the image data
  });
}
```

## 8. How do you store data locally in Ionic?

Ionic provides the Storage module for local data storage. Here's an example of storing and retrieving data:

```typescript
import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage-angular';

constructor(private storage: Storage) {}

async storeData(key: string, value: any) {
  await this.storage.set(key, value);
}

async retrieveData(key: string) {
  return await this.storage.get(key);
}
```

## 9. How do you handle form validation in Ionic?

Ionic uses Angular's built-in form validation. Here's an example of validating an input field:

```html
<ion-input [(ngModel)]="name" required></ion-input>
<ion-note *ngIf="name.invalid && name.touched">Name is required</ion-note>
```

## 10. How do you handle platform-specific code in Ionic?

Ionic provides the Platform module to detect the current platform. Here's an example of platform-specific code:

```typescript
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular';

constructor(private platform: Platform) {}

doPlatformSpecificStuff() {
  if (this.platform.is('ios')) {
    // iOS-specific code
  } else if (this.platform.is('android')) {
    // Android-specific code
  }
}
```

## 11. How do you use Ionic's built-in components and styles?

Ionic provides a wide range of pre-built UI components and styles. Here's an example of using an ion-button:

```html
<ion-button (click)="doSomething()">Click Me</ion-button>
```

## 12. How do you handle navigation back in Ionic?

You can use the NavController to navigate back. Here's an example of navigating back:

```typescript
import { NavController } from '@ionic/angular';

constructor(private navCtrl: NavController) {}

goBack() {
  this.navCtrl.goBack();
}
```

## 13. How do you handle push notifications in Ionic?

Ionic provides plugins like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications. Here's an example of receiving and handling push notifications:

```typescript
import { FCM } from '@ionic-native/fcm/ngx';

constructor(private fcm: FCM) {}

initializePushNotifications() {
  this.fcm.onNotification().subscribe((data) => {
    // Handle the received notification
  });
}
```
